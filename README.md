MATLAB scripts to align and process thermal infrared images of a river in Peru. 

MATLAB [script](/Movie_Script_IR_Weather.m) to plot the infrared images through time, while simultaneously plotting the stream temperatures and the meteorological data, and save the output as a [movie](/IR_Video_Weather_40s.mov). Example movie uploaded here is only a 40s clip of the full movie.
